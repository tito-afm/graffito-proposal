                <img src="img/cula-1.png" alt="">
                <p>This site features an array of translucent cards displaying information that are overlayed on top of
                    an expansive single image. <br><br>
                    These cards are a good reference point for the metadata pop-up that will appear on my site for their
                    method of displaying information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="img-card">
                <img src="img/cula-2.png" alt="">
                <p>The colour palette is almost monochromatic besides this vibrant and eye-catching green. The
                    monochrome aspect helps makes the site feel clean and sleek. <br><br> The green colour will be good
                    for usability and guiding the user's attention.</p>

        <section style="width: 96%; margin-top: 1em;" class="image-row">
            <div class="img-card">
                <img src="img/Inspiration - Teletech.png" alt="">
                <p>This website is another that features a large single image, with information and navigation on the
                    perimeters. The varying proportions and scale of the various text help makes the page feel dynamic.
                    <br><br> Also, the low-res aesthetic helps relate the site to technology, which makes sense
                    considering this is a site for a techno party organization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="img-card">
                <img src="img/Inspiration - Teletech2.png" alt="">
                <p>Teletech also features a playable game within their site. This is resonant for me as it adds depth
                    and dynamism to the website to feature this minigame buried within it. <br><br>
                    I aim to also include a sense of play on my website with the "make your own tag" feature. </p>

        <a class="external-link" href="https://gufram.it/en">
            <div>VISIT</div>
        </a>

        <section style="width: 96%; margin-top: 1em;" class="image-row">
            <div class="img-card">
                <img style="border: 1px solid black" src="img/Inspiration - Gufram - 1.png" alt="">
                <p>This site displays the various art objects in its database in this messy, sporadic manner, called
                    "space" according to the button at the bottom. Hovering over an object tells its name and the client
                    it was for, and you can click through to read more about it. <br><br>
                    this is a playful way to display the database of entries, especially as it is contrasted by a more
                    rigid grid system if you click the "grid" button.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="img-card">
                <img style="border: 1px solid black" src="img/Inspiration - Gufram - 2.png" alt="">
                <p>The alternate "grid" display is a nice contrast. It allows the user to view the work as more of a
                    catalogue. <br><br>
                    I would also like to contrast the collage of graffiti on the wall with a similar grid display. Each
                    tag would be displayed in isolation in a single cell of the grid, and user's could peruse the whole
                    collection free of the "wall experience".</p>

        <section style="width: 96%; margin-top: 1em;" class="image-row">
            <div class="img-card">
                <img style="width:75%" src="img/Inspiration - Aten7.png" alt="">
                <p>Aten7 is a website that provides narrative backstory for a roleplaying game. This section of the site
                    features this timeline of crucial events, and users can scroll, drag, or button press to progress
                    the node on the timeline through various years until it reaches a new "event", which then changes
                    the environment setting behind it.
                    <br><br>
                    This will help inform my approach for the timeline feature for the primary wall of my site. How will
                    I connote progression or advancement inside the UI of the timeline? How have they chosen to
                    increment the time periods between events?
