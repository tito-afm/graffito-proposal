            <h1>Field of Study</h1>
        <div></div>
            <p>This interactive website will focus on graffiti in the local urban environment. The website will draw
                attention to a few key themes that relate to graffiti, network culture, or both. These include:</p>
            <li>ephemerality & temporality</li>
            <li>territorial claim</li>
            <li>communication and social networking</li>
            <li>archives & archival storytelling</li>
            <li>aliases</li>
        </div>

        <div class="text-chunk">
            <h1>Concept</h1>
            <div></div>
            <p>An interactive, digitally archived wall of graffiti that can reveal the “metadata” of each and every tag
                on it, illustrating a network of taggers and walls, and the various (fictitious) interactions that take
                place between them.
                <br><br>
                The digital presentation and archival detail of the graffiti contrasts completely with the cryptic,
                ephemeral, and tactile nature of graffiti. It is a culture that thrives off of being visible by many but
                understood by only a few, as well as existing ephemerally, as tags are written over with time, or whole
                walls are cleaned or repainted. But there is a history in layers on these walls like the sediment of the
                Earth.

            <h1>Intentions</h1>
            <div></div>
            <p>From a personal standpoint, I aim to emulate my own engagement with the graffiti I see in Montreal. I
                don’t participate, but I observe it and recognize prolific names. I respect my inability to know the
                details of who / what / where etc. But as a result, I am left to project my own imagined narratives and
                characters that are behind it.
                <br><br>
                I aim to generate appreciation of graffiti not for just its aesthetic value, but rather for it as a tool
                to communicate, interact, and stake claims on your surroundings outside of any rigid institutional
                structures or social expectations.

            <h1>Project Breakdown</h1>
            <div></div>
            <h3>The Wall</h3>
            <p>The user is presented with a brick wall covered in graffiti. It has many tags, of various styles and
                sizes, some overlapping others. The user is able to hover over each tag and uncover the “metadata” of
                the tag, learning when it was written, who wrote it (a portrait of them, their name), and any notable
                statuses of that tagger.
                <br><br>
                The wall exists in the real-world, specifically in Montreal. Though it is presented here with digital
                aesthetics to convey that it has been digitally archived.
                <br><br>
                The Wall will serve as the primary hub of the website, featuring the majority of the content, but will
                lead to secondary walls or locations that are more single-purpose.
            </p>

            <h3>Graffito Metadata</h3>
            <p>Each tag on the wall may be hovered over to reveal a window that contains the tags metadata. This will provide the sort of information that is either immediately obvious (such as the alias of the writer) or otherwise near impossible to glean from observing a tag in real life (when it was written, where else it appears, the connections to other writers it may have). 
                <br><br>
                This metadata window will show a low-fidelity portrait of the writer, their other aliases, and a log of recent activity.
                <br><br>
                It will also note if this tag has appeared in other locations around the city (or country?), and potentially link the user to a notable location of its appearance. For example, the tag may have been written at a huge scale on a train car in Halifax. The metadata would link you to view this secondary location. 
            <br><br>
            Similarly, the metadata will show if this tag was involved in any affiliation or rivalry. For example, if the tag was recently crossed out by another tagger on a different wall, the metadata would mention this and provide a link to see this other wall.
            </p>

            <h3>Timescrubbing</h3>
            <p>This hub wall will have another dimension, which will bring to life the ephemeral and temporal quality of graffiti. There will be a tool that will allow you to jump backwards and forwards along a timeline in increments of weeks / months / years(?) in order to see the progression of the tagging that occurred on the wall, and the resulting layering that happens as taggers write over each other’s pieces. You may also see the wall be abruptly cleaned, or painted over in one fresh coat, thus obscuring all that was there, only for the accumulation process to restart over again with new tags.</p>
        
        <h3>Write Your Own Tag</h3>
        <p>Users will be able to write their own tag on the main hub wall. Using a pop-up canvas window, you will use the mouse to draw out a crude tag and it will be integrated into an open area on the “present day” version of the main wall. As users scrub forward in time, they will see their tag get progressively more covered by other tags, and eventually see it disappear. 
            <br><br>
            This will add a personal component to the interaction with the wall, potentially having the user consider more deeply each tag of the multitude they will see on the wall.
